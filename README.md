### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jime, a FullStack developer that has a slight inclination for backend work and an eye on games development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a group project building a Classroom-like platform. We are very excited about it! And I'm enjoying the challenges we are encountering! We are taking a deeper dive into JavaScript, Sequelize, Express, Node, PostgreSQL, React, Redux, and making a lot of configuration!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m diving into Firebase to handle authentication, and React Native is next in line to start engaging with mobile applications development.
